**Validator Name:** anmd  
**Validator Address:** storyvaloper1gkntqz6j3cze8gnp8zu360mvckuahaqhavp2uk  
**About the Validator:**  
I am operating a validator under the moniker "anmd" on the Iliad-0 network and Story Testnet. My node is currently hosted at `g2m.ddns.net:26656`, running on an **Intel i7-14700** processor, which has 20 cores (8 Performance-cores and 12 Efficient-cores) and 28 threads. The Performance-cores can reach up to 5.2 GHz, ensuring high efficiency for validating tasks. My setup also includes 96 GB of RAM and 4 TB of NVMe storage. My validator is currently inactive with a voting power of 1 IP and a self-bond of 1.1 IP. The commission rate is set at 10%, with a max rate of 50% and a max change rate of 5%.

**Networks Participated In:**  
I am actively participating in the Iliad Testnet, Warden Protocol, and Nubit networks. My validator is designed to contribute to the growth and stability of these blockchain ecosystems by running both validator and archived nodes.

**Recent Contributions:**  
I have recently deployed an archived node on the Iliad Testnet, providing public endpoints for other users. Additionally, I ran a node on the Warden Protocol, where I successfully addressed issues related to frequent IP changes by implementing DDNS. I also have experience running a Nubit light node. My validator node on Story Testnet is currently in an inactive state but prepared to activate and participate in network consensus.
